        <h3>About Lyst</h3>
        <p>Ever felt that your days are passing you by without any tangible output? What did you accomplish in the past month? What are your goals for the next three months? Look at the things that you have been doing and the things that you’re planning to do next — do they mean anything to you if you are to die today? Having a bucket list reminds you of what’s really important to you so that you can act on them. </p>
        <p>A bucket list is a number of experiences or achievements that a person hopes to have or accomplish during their lifetime. Lyst is the best place to create your bucket lists and update them as you go! You can organize your buckets from travel-related lists to photography to fitness to ANYTHING YOU LIKE!</p>
